## Needs Gordon

Each item names the default already in use, so the build never waits.

| Since | Question | Default in use |
|---|---|---|
| Oct 24 2:01 AM | `.env` is missing, so there's no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `NESSIE_KEY`. Copy `C:\dev\secrets\cindia.env` to `.env` | The upgrades that need these keys stay scripted |

## Cut and simulated

Everything that ends up cut or still on scripted events, for the README and Devpost.
